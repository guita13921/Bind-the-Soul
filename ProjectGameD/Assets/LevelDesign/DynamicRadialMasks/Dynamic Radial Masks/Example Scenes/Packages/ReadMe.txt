Folder contains 3 packages of the "Dynamic Radial Masks" example scenes, designed for 3 different Unity render pipelines.

Based on a projectâ€™s render pipeline import only one of the included packages.

Each example scene is explaind in the Manual file (Documentation folder).


Note, after importing example scenes, some shaders may fail to compile and print errors in the Console window. Just re-import them (Dynamic Radial Masks\Example Scenes\Files\Shaders).
